🪄 Image smoothing involves reducing noise and enhancing visual coherence. Understanding these techniques offers insights into their unique characteristics and applications in image processing.


✍🏻 Mean filtering achieves smoothing by replacing each pixel's value with the average of its neighbors.

✍🏻 Median filtering, effective against salt-and-pepper noise, replaces each pixel with the median of its neighbors, preserving edges.

✍🏻 Gaussian filtering utilizes a convolution operation with a Gaussian kernel for uniform smoothing.

✍🏻 Bilateral filtering considers spatial proximity and intensity differences, excelling in noise reduction while preserving details.
